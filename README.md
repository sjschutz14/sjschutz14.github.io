#### Description:
CL Detailing is a responsive website I built for my friend's auto detailing that he enjoys to do on the side when he's not working. It's a simple site with some nice aesthetics that I built to be relatively minimalist so as to easiliy scale to mobile platforms. The website is contained all on one page. It incorporates Javascript, HTML, CSS, some BootStrap5 and a form I created at getform.com to handle the detailing requests and generate an email to my friend's email with the details of the request. It should be noted that most pictures and some text and merely placeholders for the time being until my friend is able to get me original photos. I am really hoping to learn some more web design skills in my next CS50 course (Web Programming with Python and JS).

I started with a boilerplate HTML script in index.html. I then linked Bootstrap, my custom CSS file, and the google font I chose to use (Roboto). I also created some global variables, various CSS variables, etc. I was going to use some icons from fontawesome but ultimately decided against it.

I began by creating a header which contained my nav bar. I used a Bootstrap nav bar but then styled it how I wanted it to look using my CSS file. I also added some JS to cause the nav bar to collapse off screen when the user scrolls down when using a computer (aka not mobile). 

I knew I wanted to use a hero banner for the landing screen because websites that incorporate them have always caught my attention. I used some minimal text here and then a responsive button that has a sort of shine effect when hovered over. 

After that I started to work on each individual section of the site. I used full view-width headings that incorporate parralax scrolling for a nice visual effect. The sections themselves consist of services offered, photos of past work performed, and a contact section. Each one of the sections uses a similar style. 

All-in-all I know my code isn't the cleanest and it could be made to scale better, but this was my first attempt at building a website completely from scratch and I think it turned out alright.
